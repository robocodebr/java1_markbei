In computer programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. 
 The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation). 
 A string is generally considered as a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding. 
 String may also denote more general arrays or other sequence (or list) data types and structures.
